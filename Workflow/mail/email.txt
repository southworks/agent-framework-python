Subject: Team Meeting Follow-up - Action Items

Hi Sarah,

I wanted to follow up on our team meeting this morning and share the action items we discussed:

1. Update the project timeline by Friday
2. Schedule client presentation for next week
3. Review the budget allocation for Q4

Please let me know if you have any questions or if I missed anything from our discussion.

Best regards,
